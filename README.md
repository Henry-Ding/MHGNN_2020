# MHGNN_2020
Meta-path based heterogeneous neural network
MHGNN is based on HetGNN, we used same datasets to test the performances of our algorithms, see https://github.com/chuxuzhang/KDD2019_HetGNN for dataset and basic usage. We same several parameters of several models,  use   model.load_state_dict(torch.load("./model_name.pt")) to load trained models.
